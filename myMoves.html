            <h3>If the user is logged in, then they can see a list of their moves and interact with them</h3>
          </section>

        Not quite sure all the functionality I want to put here, but it'll include at least 
        a list of dance moves that user knows. Possibly a reccomendation for a new move to learn
        <br>
        This also depends on the database.
