import React from "react";

export function Share() {
    return (
        <main>
            <div class="container vh-100">
                <section>
                    <h3>Websocket will be included here for sharability</h3>
                </section>

                Hoping to be able to link to FB, instagram, Tik tok socials via sharing api. Still need to look into that more
            </div>
        </main>
    )
