import React from "react";

export function MyMoves() {
    return (
        <main>
            <div class="container">
                <section>
                    <h3>If the user is logged in, then they can see a list of their moves and interact with them</h3>
                </section>

                Not quite sure all the functionality I want to put here, but it'll include at least
                a list of dance moves that user knows. Possibly a reccomendation for a new move to learn
                This also depends on the database.
            </div>
        </main>
    )
