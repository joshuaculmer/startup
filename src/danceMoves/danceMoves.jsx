                <section>
                    <h3>Dance instruction on each move will be placed here. Along with a list for all possible moves</h3>
                </section>

                I'll put some media here that will represent the instruction for different dance Moves.
                This will call the database of videos
                Still not sure if I'll have separate pages for each video, or just display them inline one at a time
            </div>

        </main>
