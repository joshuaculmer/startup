                <section>
                    <h3>Dance instruction on each move will be placed here. Along with a list for all possible moves</h3>
                </section>

                I'll put some media here that will represent the instruction for different dance Moves.
                This will call the database of videos
                Videos will update the DOM and be displayed here
            </div>

        </main>
    )
