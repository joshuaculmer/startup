# Country Dance Catalog 


# Elevator Pitch

Lets say you want to learn how to dance but only know two moves. Or you know a ton of moves but aren't sure how to use them together. The country dance catalog is a treasure trove of dance moves that will help dancers of any skill improve their dancing. Dance moves are categorized by difficulty, type, technique for convient sorting and improved learning experience for all skill levels. You will also be able to search for any move, learn it, and add it to a list of learned moves for convient access. For more advanced users, there will be an option to chain moves together by visualizing which moves lead into other moves and it can come up with combination suggestions for you known moves.

# Technology Description
- HTML: Homepage, Login and Registration page, Dance List page, my moves page, Combo generator page, a page for each dance move
- CSS: For this project a temporary image will fill the space where videos eventually will go. Effective use of icons and menu design. Contrasting color scheme for engagement and easily navegatable UI.
- Javascript/React: Provides login features and interactivity with menu filters
- Services/API usage: Depending on the implementation from a business standpoint, I will use google maps api to dipslay local dance venues. This feature will primarily fulfil the requirement for the class and not add much to the site until the business aspect is more fleshed out. 
- DB: Stores user login info, credentials, and move state. All dance moves, related videos, and move start and end positions for combination generator
- Websocket: Allows users to share the website/applet, dance move instruction, and combinations to other users.
